# SMART-M3Project
This is a project for the Interoperability of Embedded System lab at the university of Bologna.
In this project we used Smart-m3.
Smart-M3 is a content-based, semantic  subscribe-notify middleware for fine grain interoperable data distribution. It is the interoperability component of the Open Innovation Platform (OIP) created by the European Project SOFIA (2009-11). M3 stands for Multi vendor, Multi device, Multi part.

Smart-M3 main goals are:
• sharing interoperable information in Smart Environment applications
• making information in the physical world available for smart services

To use this applicantion you must download Smart-m3:
