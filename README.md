# SMART-M3Project
This is a project for the Interoperability of Embedded System lab at the university of Bologna.
In this project we used Smart-m3.
Smart-M3 is a content-based, semantic  subscribe-notify middleware for fine grain interoperable data distribution. It is the interoperability component of the Open Innovation Platform (OIP) created by the European Project SOFIA (2009-11).

Smart-M3 main goals are:

• sharing interoperable information in Smart Environment applications

• making information in the physical world available for smart services

To use this applicantion you must download Smart-m3:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/smart-m3/

The main idea of this project is to simulate several bus rides in the city of Bologna and to provide statistics at the end of the simulation. When the application starts, you can set some parameters, like which bus simulate (actually there are three option), number of days to simulate, number of rides for each bus, ticket price for a single ride etc..
Once the application is started, you should see a map with the selected bus. Each bus is represented by a particular marker; also each bus stop is marked. You should see something like this:

At the end of the simulation some statistics are provide, for example:
• Segment (path between two consecutive bus stops) with more people
• Line with the maximum number of fines
• Balance for each bus line (could be positive or negative, it depends on the number of ticket sold, the number of ticket inspector, and the number of fines)
